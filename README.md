# Python

## Description
> Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. -Wikipedia

Python is a programming language that can both be utilised to do nearly anything and still remains the perfect programming language for those who are new to programming.

## Installation

> Warning! Python has a version 2 and a version 3. Python version 2 is almost end of life, as such, development should be done in Python 3.

> Warning! On older MacOS versions and most Debian based Linux distributions both Python 2 and Python 3 are already installed by default. Running the 'python' command from a terminal will usualy start Python 2, running 'python3' starts Python 3.

> Note: You can see what version of Python your 'python' command is bound to by entering the following into a terminal:
```
python -V
```

> Warning! Do not change the Python installs that came with your system. On Linux, you can use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to easily install and manage different versions of Python.

On MacOS: MacOS comes with Python already installed. You can download the latest version of Python from https://www.python.org/
On Debian based Linux: Most distros come with Python already installed. Otherwise install it with apt:
```
sudo apt install python
```
or
```
sudo apt install python3
```

## Configuration
Unless you have used the Python installer from python.org you probably still need to install pip and virtualenv. 

## Usage

You can start Python from the command line.

Start the Python interactive shell.
```
python
```
Run a python script.
```
python ./<scriptname>.py
```

### Naming conventions
According with pep8, use under_score.
